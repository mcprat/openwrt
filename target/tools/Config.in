	  Package the created build tools as a tarball under the bin/ directory as
	  openwrt-tools-$(BOARD)-$(SUBTARGET)-gcc-$(GCCV)$(DIR_SUFFIX).
	  This can be copied into another buildroot and unpacked
	  to overwrite the tools in staging_dir with this prebuilt set.
	  The buildroot that this is used on must have the same option
	  for CONFIG_AUTOREMOVE as the buildroot this was built on.
