	  Package the local build tools as a tarball under the bin/ directory as
	  openwrt-tools.$(HOST_OS)-$(HOST_ARCH).tar.xz
	  This can be copied into another buildroot and unpacked
	  to overwrite current tools with the ones in this prebuilt set
	  or to skip the need to build the tools altogether.
	  The buildroot that this is used on must have CONFIG_AUTOREMOVE enabled.
	  Unpack directly in the top level directory (openwrt folder)
	  using the untar_touch.sh script that touches every file after it is unpacked.
	  $ scripts/untar_touch.sh openwrt-tools.Linux-x86_64.tar.xz .
