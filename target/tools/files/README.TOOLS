This is part of the Openwrt SDK. It contains just the build tools created
by the buildroot.

It can be copied to another Openwrt buildroot and unpacked there,
the paths for default staging_dir and build_dir are preserved.

This should be unpacked directly in the top level directory (openwrt folder)
using the untar_touch.sh script that touches every file after it is unpacked.

example:

	$ scripts/untar_touch.sh openwrt-tools.Linux-x86_64.tar.xz .
